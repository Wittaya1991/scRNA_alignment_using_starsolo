######## ScRNA analysis pipeline without using cellranger
######## This pipeline utilises starsolo which is a built-in algorithm in cellranger
######## This pipeline is suitable with scRNA analysis that the cell/nuclei capture is not processed by 10x Genomics GEMs


######## Important information
#### 1. User need to supply a list of cellbarcodes (whitelist)
#### 2. User should have a clear understanding of cellbarcode and UMI sequences because the number of cellbarcode and UMI sequences will have to be supplied manually
